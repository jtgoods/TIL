f-strings (or, formatted string literals) can convert variables or math into a string
they use {} to convert an integer or float, variable, or mathematical function into a string

example:

name = 🐍

age = 36

print(f"My name is {name}, I'm {age} years old") 

**Output: My name is 🐍, I'm 36 years old**

hours_worked = 8

hourly_wage = 25

print(f"Today I earned ${hours_worked * hourly_wage}")

**Output: Today I earned $200**
